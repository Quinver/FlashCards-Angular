# Flashcards
I'm trying out diffrent frameworks to get the feel of them. And this is my attempt to work with Angular with Asp.net core as backend.

The app itself is just the thousands flashcard app. You can add/remove/edit decks, and in the decks you can do the same for the cards. I have not used any css frameworks because my skills were getting a bit rusty in that area.

## Local Install
To run it I've decided on docker.
Only tested on my own arch system, will test it later on windows.

#### Linux:

1. First, make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. Use your favorite package manager (tested with pacman on Arch Linux):
```bash
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose
```
2. Start the Docker service to ensure itâ€™s running:
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```
3. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quinver/FlashCards-Angular.git
```
4. Change to the root directory of the project:
```bash
cd FlashCards-Angular
```
5. Finally, run the Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```
### Windows:
This is out of my head so take with a grain of salt.
1. Install docker from the [download](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) page.
2. Restart system if needed.
3. Run docker-desktop.
4. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quinver/FlashCards-Angular.git
```
5. Change to the root directory of the project:
```bash
cd FlashCards-Angular
```
6. Finally, run the Docker containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
## Closure
This was the easiest way I could think of to let you run this project locally, if you have any tips/improvements for the installation, feel free to contact me.
